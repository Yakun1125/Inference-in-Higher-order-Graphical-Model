# Inference-in-Higher-order-Graphical-Model

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of Linear Programming (LP) relaxations for inference in higher-order undirected graphical models. It specifically focuses on two practical applications:

1. **Image Denoising**: Utilizing graphical models to recover clean image from noisy observation.
2. **Error-Correcting Decoding**: Recover ground turth message transmitted from noisy channel.

## Repository Structure
- **denoising/**: Contains datasets and scripts related to the image denoising experiments.
- **decoding/**: Includes data and scripts for experiments on error-correcting decoding.
